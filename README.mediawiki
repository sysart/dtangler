'''dtangler''' is a suite of tools to analyze dependencies.
dtangler's primary features currently are:
* DSM GUI (Dependency Structure Matrix)
* DSM text-based output
* Command line dependency analyzer (primary targeted for use in automated builds)
* Support for reading dependency info from a text file
* Built in support for Java dependency analysis (jar/class folder, package, and class level)
* The user can write dependency rules and dtangler checks if the code follows the rules.
